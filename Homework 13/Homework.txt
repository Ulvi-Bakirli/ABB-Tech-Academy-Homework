Improve the project: add the ability to work with the file system.

Technical requirements:
Add to the application the ability to save data locally to your computer.
Add the ability to load previously saved data (new item in the main menu instead of generating test data).
To download data in the FamilyService and FamilyDao classes, add loadData method which accepts the List<Family> families and downloads it to our database. -For each action, add an item to the main menu.
The list of families with all data should be saved/downloaded.

Not a necessary task of advanced complexity:
Create a separate service (class) for logging, which will have 2 methods: info() (log information message) and error() (log error). Both methods accept the message for logging, but give a different format: 01/01/2019 15:35 [DEBUG]/[ERROR] message.
Add a call to the logger.info() method in all methods CollectionFamilyDao with an info message such as receiving a family list, adding a new family, deleting a family, etc.
При обработке исключений логируйте их с помощью метода logger.error().
When processing exceptions, log them using the application.log.
Make sure that the recording is always done at the end of the file from a new line.
